# sqla-repository

A SQLAlchemy repository implementation inspired by Spring Data JPA repositories.

## Build, Test, and Lint

This project uses Poetry for dependency management.

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run a specific test
poetry run pytest tests/test_repository.py::test_find_by_id

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=sqla_repository

# Lint code
poetry run ruff check .

# Format code
poetry run ruff format .
```

## Architecture

### Core Pattern: Generic Repository

The `Repository[EntityType, IdType]` class in `src/sqla_repository/core.py` provides CRUD operations for SQLAlchemy models through Python generics. Key implementation details:

- **Type inference**: The `__init_subclass__` method automatically extracts the model type from generic parameters (e.g., `Repository[Artist, int]` sets `cls.model = Artist`)
- **Base class requirement**: All models must inherit from `sqla_repository.core.Base` (which extends `DeclarativeBase`)
- **Session management**: Repositories receive a `Session` in `__init__` and use it for all database operations
- **Transaction control**: The repository provides `flush()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods, but operations like `save()` only flush by default—commit is the caller's responsibility

### Custom Repository Methods

To add custom queries, extend `Repository` and use `self._model_type()` to get the model class and `self.session` for queries:

```python
class ArtistRepository(Repository[Artist, int]):
    def find_by_name(self, name: str) -> list[Artist]:
        return self.session.query(self._model_type()).filter_by(Name=name).all()
```

### Test Setup Pattern

Tests use a session-scoped SQLite in-memory database loaded from `tests/resources/chinook.db`. Repository fixtures are session-scoped and share the same database connection. See `tests/conftest.py` for the fixture setup.

## Conventions

- **Line length**: 79 characters (enforced by Ruff)
- **None validation**: Repository methods validate that entities and IDs are not None, raising `ValueError` if violated
- **Model generation**: The optional `gen` dependency group includes `sqlacodegen` for generating model classes from existing databases
- **Naming**: Models use PascalCase with their original database column names (e.g., `Artist.ArtistId`, `Artist.Name`)
- **Docstrings**: 
    - Docstrings are to be written in English and follow the Google style guide.
    - All public methods have docstrings describing their behavior and parameters
    - Private methods (those starting with an underscore) do not require docstrings unless their behavior is non-obvious
    - Class docstrings describe the purpose of the class and any important implementation details or usage notes
    - Modules should have a docstring at the top describing their contents and any important context for users
    - Docstrings should be concise but informative, providing enough context for users to understand the method's purpose and how to use it without needing to read the implementation details
    - Tests should have docstrings describing the purpose of the test and what behavior it is verifying, especially for more complex test cases
